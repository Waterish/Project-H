Space Life - Python/Kivy EditionThis is a Python version of the web-based game "Space Life", rebuilt using the Kivy framework for cross-platform deployment, including Android.Project Structuremain.py: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the Kivy app and the main game widget, and bridges the UI with the game logic.game_logic.py: Contains the GameLogic class, which manages the game state and all core mechanics. This file is UI-agnostic.game_data.py: Stores the large initial game state dictionary, keeping static data separate from the application logic.spacelife.kv: The Kivy language file that defines the layout and appearance of the user interface.buildozer.spec: The configuration file for Buildozer, used to package the Python application into an Android APK.savegame.json: This file will be created automatically in the app's data directory to persist your game state.How to Run and DeployPrerequisitesPython: Make sure you have Python 3 installed.Kivy: Install Kivy and its dependencies:pip install "kivy[full]"
Buildozer: Install Buildozer for packaging:pip install buildozer
Android SDK/NDK: Buildozer will attempt to download the required Android tools for you the first time you run it. Follow any on-screen prompts.Running on DesktopTo test the application on your computer before deploying, simply run the main.py file:python main.py
Building for AndroidPlace all the project files (main.py, game_logic.py, game_data.py, spacelife.kv, buildozer.spec) in the same directory.Open your terminal or command prompt in that directory.Run the following Buildozer command:buildozer android debug deploy run
This command will:Download the necessary Android SDK and NDK if you don't have them.Build the Python code and its dependencies into an Android project.Compile the project into a debug APK file.Install the APK onto a connected Android device (the device must have USB debugging enabled).Run the application on the device.The first build can take a very long time. Subsequent builds will be much faster.
